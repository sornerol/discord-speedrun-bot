# Discord RaceBot
Discord RaceBot is a Discord bot used to manage speedrun races. It is similar in functionality to SpeedRunsLive, an IRC-based speedrun race service.

Discord RaceBot was developed in C# using .NET Core 2.2. It uses the Discord.NET API wrapper for interfacing with Discord, and uses a MySQL database for storing race and entry data.

The Discord RaceBot server is currently in closed beta.
