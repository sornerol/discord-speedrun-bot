# Discord RaceBot
Discord RaceBot is a Discord bot used to manage speedrun races. It is similar in functionality to SpeedRunsLive, an IRC-based speedrun race service.

Discord RaceBot was developed in C# using .NET Core 2.2. It uses the Discord.NET API wrapper for interfacing with Discord, and uses a MySQL database for storing race and entry data.

I built Discord RaceBot back in 2019, before I really understood principles of writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code. As such, RaceBot's code base is quite a mess. In addition, I made RaceBot at a time when there wasn't really a good alternative to the dated SpeedRunsLive IRC platform. Since RaceBot came into being, [racetime.gg](https://racetime.gg) has become the premier video game race platform, and it does so better than SRL or my own Discord racebot ever could dream of.

Based on these facts, I have no plans to continue development on Discord RaceBot. I will leave the code here on GitHub in case it can benefit someone else, but I don't expect that I will be making any further updates.

Thank you to everyone who participated in races and submitted feedback. This was a fun project to work on, and I believe it helped me break into a career that I truly enjoy (despite the fact I had no idea what I was doing when I built it).
